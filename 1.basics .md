## basics 
 ## 1.WHAT IS A DDOS ATTACK ?   
 
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to affect the availability of a targeted system, such as a website or application, to legitimate end users. Typically, attackers generate large volumes of packets or requests ultimately overwhelming the target system. In case of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, and the attacker uses multiple compromised or controlled sources to generate the attack.

In general, DDoS attacks can be segregated by which layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model they attack. They are most common at the Network (layer 3), Transport (Layer 4), Presentation (Layer 6) and Application (Layer 7) Layers.

While thinking about mitigation techniques against these attacks, it is useful to group them as Infrastructure layer (Layers 3 and 4) and Application Layer (Layer 6 and 7) attacks.

### 1.Infrastructure Layer Attacks

attacks like User Datagram Packet (UDP) floods. These attacks are usually large in volume and aim to overload the capacity of the network or the application servers. But fortunately, these are also the type of attacks that have clear signatures and are easier to detect.

 ### 2.Application Layer Attacks

These attacks are typically small in volume compared to the Infrastructure layer attacks but tend to focus on particular expensive parts of the application thereby making it unavailable for real users. For instance, a flood of HTTP requests to a login page, or an expensive search API, or even Wordpress XML-RPC floods (also known as Wordpress pingback attacks).
There is no free lanchers in the world.

## DDoS Protection Techniques-

### Reduce Attack Surface Area

minimize the surface area that can be attacked thereby limiting the options for attackers and allowing you to build protections in a single place.we do not expose our application or resources to ports, protocols or applications from where they do not expect any communication. Thus, minimizing the possible points of attack and letting us concentrate our mitigation efforts.

In some cases, you can do this by placing your computation resources behind Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) or Load Balancers and restricting direct Internet traffic to certain parts of your infrastructure like your database servers. In other cases, you can use firewalls or Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control what traffic reaches your applications.

### Plan for Scale

The two key considerations for mitigating large scale volumetric DDoS attacks are bandwidth (or transit) capacity and server capacity to absorb and mitigate attacks.

#### Transit capacity.

When architecting your applications, make sure your hosting provider provides ample redundant Internet connectivity that allows you to handle large volumes of traffic. Since the ultimate objective of DDoS attacks is to affect the availability of your resources/applications, you should locate them, not only close to your end users but also to large Internet exchanges which will give your users easy access to your application even during high volumes of traffic. Additionally, web applications can go a step further by employing Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) and smart DNS resolution services which provide an additional layer of network infrastructure for serving content and resolving DNS queries from locations that are often closer to your end users.

##### Server capacity.

Most DDoS attacks are volumetric attacks that use up a lot of resources; it is, therefore, important that you can quickly scale up or down on your computation resources. You can either do this by running on larger computation resources or those with features like more extensive network interfaces or enhanced networking that support larger volumes. Additionally, it is also common to use load balancers to continually monitor and shift loads between resources to prevent overloading any one resource.

## what is cyber security ?

cybersecurity is the body of technologies , processes and practices dessigned to protect neiwork,computers programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access.

1. keylogger-A keylogger or keystroke logger/keyboard capturing is a form of malware or hardware that keeps track of and records your keystrokes as you type. It takes the information and sends it to a hacker using a command-and-control (C&C) server.

solution- use virtual keyboards

--> we do not use pirated software.People have been using unlicensed software for multiple purposes, from such benign things as getting the latest operating system free of charge, with pirated Windows leading the stakes, to spreading illegal software programs for personal profit. In this way we are giving our privacy.

# --> Firewall(antiivirus)

Deep packet inspection (DPI) is one of those more sophisticated firewall techniques. In addition to blocking traffic to or from known Tor relays, a DPI firewall can be configured to look deeper into the network packets, beyond the source and the destination addresses.

# --> vulnerability
A vulnerability is a weakness in an IT system that can be exploited by an attacker to deliver a successful attack. Ex: your mobile phone ,what is the weakness it is update your app on weekly basis atleast because this way some new features are added and some old features are removed to decrease the chance of hacking and save from loopholes.


# Cyber Attack 

A cyber attack is any malicious attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer, computing system or computer network with the intent to cause damage
